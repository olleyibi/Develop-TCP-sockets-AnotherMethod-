Optimization Rules
In order to optimize the supplied codon list, the rules stated below must be followed:
1. Ensure a file containing the possible codon combination mapped to their respective amino acid is provided.
2. The optimization function makes use of the codon and amino acid list generated by the get_csv(message)
3. The supplied RNA string is broken down into a group of three nucleotides (a Codon) and each codon is compared with the codon list
- If the combination is not found in the list, an error message is returned
- If the combination is found, it is mapped to its respective amino acid
4. The function checks for other combination mapped to the same amino acid and replaces the codon with a new one.
